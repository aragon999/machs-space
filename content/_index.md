# Welcome to ma[ch|x]s'space

My name is Max and I work for [swkweb](https://www.swk-web.com/) and sometimes do [research in particle physics](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1899569). This blog will probably be most about technical stuff, which interests me. You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/aragon999/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/xAragon/) and [Mastodon](https://phpc.social/@aragon999).
